# Building a station

* TOC
{:toc}

Building the first station or later additional stations is not complicated at all and, for the most part, players have complete freedom in how they design and build their station. There are a few rules and recommendations that must or should be followed during construction.

> **Terminology**
> New players often use incorrect terminology when asking questions, which leads to various misunderstandings.
> The individual parts of a station are called **blocks**. Some blocks allow additional **facilities** to be installed.
> Blocks must be distinguished from *modules*, which are installed on *ships*.
> **In short:** ships have *modules*, stations have *blocks*.

## New station

New players build their first station as part of the tutorial, which is included in the game and guides them through their first steps. More advanced players who meet certain criteria (e.g. the level of their main station) can also build additional stations. You just need to fly with any ship to the place where the station should stand and, in the Production menu (keyboard shortcut `w`), click the button to create a new station:

### Where to build a station ?

Choosing the position of a new station is *very important*, because once built, the station **cannot be moved**. The only option is to *dismantle the station*, collect the materials from it and then build a *new station* elsewhere.

The rules state that a new station *cannot be built* in the *"vicinity"* of another station, whether player-owned or NPC. This distance varies depending on whether the given station belongs to another player, a player from the same zone, or an NPC. In any case, it is advisable to build your station in a relatively quiet place.

> **You cannot build a station closer than:**
> 80km from your own station or another station belonging to your zone
> 250km from a station belonging to a player from another zone
> 5500km from an NPC station

Since the foundation of successful progress in the game is the mining and processing of mined material, it is very advantageous to have a station:
- near a fragment whose purity is (ideally) 100%
- near an NPC station where the mined material can be processed

> These recommendations do not have to be followed by players who plan a very early entry into a player zone, because within a zone it is possible to travel between stations using a stasis card and also to use the developed stations of zone players for material processing and item production.

### Mandatory blocks

Every station has *two mandatory blocks* without which it cannot exist. When building a new station, a dialog window opens where you need to choose these blocks. At the top you choose the *command block*, at the bottom the *service block*. On the right side you can see the total price of the station and the time required to build it, as well as the station’s visibility to other players (visibility can be changed at any time in *Station settings*, see below).

> **Warning:**
> The station fee is not everything that station construction requires.
> After choosing the mandatory blocks, you must deliver **construction materials** for the build to start; without them, construction *will not begin*!
> It is up to the player to study in advance the amount of required materials and, based on that, decide
> which blocks they can afford to build. [Link to the relevant chapter in Source](https://source.outspacegame.com/en/space-station/blocks/list/)

#### Command block

The chosen type and level of the command block determines all the main parameters of the station. Additional blocks can later be gradually attached to this block, allowing the player to expand their station, its parameters, and the services it provides. When choosing the *type of command block*, the game offers two options – **Aquarius** and **Odyssey**.

> **A good tip:**
> In general, new players are advised to choose **Odyssey**, because compared to Vodnár it has *greater maintenance capacity* and also allows you to build up to 2 *accommodation facilities*, which means it essentially provides exactly the equipment a new player should focus on.

Of course, the player should try to build the command block at *the highest level possible*, because higher block levels offer significantly better station parameters.

#### Service block

On the “bottom part” of the station there must be a *service block*, whose role is to provide support services for the station. New players will appreciate a higher maintenance level, so for their first station they should choose the block **Odyssey Maintenance 1**.

## Additional block facilities

Some blocks allow adding so-called *facilities*. These are extensions of a given block that either improve its parameters (e.g. the number of accommodation units or the station’s battery capacity) or add completely new services (e.g. Hangar, Recycler, etc.). New facilities can be added to a block *only after the construction of that block has been completely finished*.

1. Dock at the station with any ship
2. Open the Bridge
3. Move the mouse over the desired block and, in the floating window, choose New Facility

   ![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-01-13-35-27.png)

5. In the next window you can choose the facility you want to add to the given block  
   > The number and types of facilities that can be installed on a specific block are fixed by the block type.
   > Therefore it is not possible to install different facilities or a larger number of a chosen facility.
6. Each facility requires materials to build, so construction will not start until you add the required amounts of materials

## Station weapons

During the first days of their career, a player’s station has immunity against Evil. This means the game will not actively send raids of Evil against this station. However, after a few days the immunity ends and it is up to the player to protect their station. Protection is relatively simple – you just need to build *station weapons*.

Station weapons are standard station blocks whose task is to actively search for and destroy enemies in the vicinity of the station. This applies not only to game-generated Evil, but also to enemies among players (e.g. players who attack the station or players from another zone – depending on the station settings).

1. Dock your ship at the station
2. Open the Bridge
3. At the top there is a button to add a new block
4. In the window that opens, use the `<` and `>` buttons to find the block **Serpent HF100** and confirm
5. Deliver the required materials to the construction and wait for the construction to be completed

> **VERY IMPORTANT!!!**
> The Serpent HF100 block by itself **cannot** defend the station, because it does not contain **any weapon**!!
> The weapon must be installed manually after the block has been built:
> - open the Bridge
> - find your new Serpent HF100 block and hover the mouse cursor over it
> - choose the Weapons button at the top
> - in the window that opens, select the *Primary weapon*: **CONFESSOR Laser**
> 
>   ![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-01-16-55-18.png)

A block equipped in this way can actively defend the station against enemies.  
Let me add two fairly important notes:
1. Station weapons do *not* protect the station against parasites.  
   A parasite is such a small organism that these large weapons are unable to detect and target it.
2. For truly effective defense, it is necessary to build **ideally 5 blocks** of Serpent HF100 and equip them with weapons.  
   The rule is – the more, the better.

## Energy and Maintenance of the station

Every station has a number of different parameters depending on which blocks and facilities it consists of. However, there are parameters that are **critical** for every station and must be constantly **monitored** and **planned** before every station change. As soon as any of these parameters drops into negative numbers, the station begins to *degrade and decay*. For the correct functioning of the station, these values must be kept safely above zero.

After docking *at your own station*, you can monitor these parameters in the upper-left corner of the screen:

![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-01-17-40-52.png)

- **Energy** has the following parameters:
  - the station’s total capacity
  - the station’s *hourly energy gain*
  - the efficiency of energy gain (depends on the size of the star and the station’s distance from it)
- **Maintenance:**
  - the absolute maintenance value (the station’s ability to repair itself)
  - in parentheses you can see the base and bonus components of maintenance

### Energy

Every station needs *energy* for its proper operation. The station obtains it from its nearest star and stores it in energy storage units. What matters is the distance of the station from this star.

#### Gaining energy

The station captures energy using blocks (and their facilities). Some blocks (and their facilities) can capture energy with fairly high efficiency, others are less efficient, and there are blocks that cannot do it at all. An excellent source of this information is [Source](https://source.outspacegame.com/en/space-station/blocks/list/), where every block and facility has a precisely listed energy value it can gain or spend per hour.

For example, the command block Odyssey 3 has the following values listed, according to which it can gain up to 1800EU every hour.

![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-01-17-23-06.png)

On the other hand, we can install, for example, an Accommodation facilities (Hub) into this block, which *consumes* energy:

![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-01-17-25-11.png)

> **Important:**
> The total sum of all energy **gains** and **losses** of all station *blocks and facilities* gives us the station’s **energy balance**.
> Every player tries to achieve *the highest possible energy balance* for their station.

#### Storing energy

Besides the ability to *gain energy*, some blocks and facilities also have the ability to *store* energy. This parameter is available in [Source](https://source.outspacegame.com/en/space-station/blocks/list/) for every station block and facility. For example, the Odyssey 3 command block by itself can store up to 33000EU.

![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-01-17-33-39.png)

> The station’s total energy capacity is calculated as the sum of the capacities of all its blocks and facilities.

### Maintenance

The station’s Maintenance parameter expresses its ability to repair itself. If this parameter is too low, the station loses this ability and starts to *degrade*. Therefore, before any station change it is necessary to plan in advance what impact the change will have on maintenance. Similarly to energy, some station blocks can *increase* maintenance, others *have no effect* on it, and others *reduce* it.

For example, the Odyssey 3 command module itself has a small but still positive maintenance value:

![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-01-17-48-43.png)

In contrast, the [Triton Living Ring](https://source.outspacegame.com/en/space-station/blocks/list/2/) drastically reduces the station’s overall maintenance value:

![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-01-17-50-38.png)

> **Important:**
> Simply *building* blocks that can increase maintenance **is not enough**. Maintenance also needs to be
> **performed**. Maintenance on the station is always performed by **colonists**.
> For the maintenance increase to *take effect*, it is necessary to ensure a **sufficient number of colonists** on the station.
> Therefore, it may happen that after building a new block (or a temporary decrease in the number of colonists) the maintenance value will be *temporarily* insufficient. As soon as the colonists multiply again, the maintenance value will return to the expected level.

#### Further increasing maintenance

The station’s maintenance level can (and should) be increased in other ways than just by building blocks with a positive maintenance value. There are several special cards that can be “played” on the station to increase its maintenance level.

![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-01-18-06-43.png) ![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-01-18-07-08.png)

## Further improving the station

A station consisting only of a Command block and a Service block (with each block equipped with all available facilities) is fully functional, but after a short time it will no longer be sufficient. That is when it’s time to start thinking about building additional blocks. Again, note that building each block, besides money and a production slot, also requires different amounts of materials. Therefore, the construction of additional blocks must be well planned.

> **Important:**
> Before starting to build a new block or facility, carefully calculate whether, even after the object
> is completed, the station will still have **sufficient energy gain and maintenance level**!!

Other blocks with which you can improve your station, for example, include:
- a marketplace (allows selling and buying items at your own station)
- warehouses (a place to store your items, raw materials and products)
- solar panels and additional batteries (to increase energy gain and storage capacity)
- accommodation for more colonists (increasing maintenance and possibly allowing population growth)

## Station settings

Each station contains a relatively large number of different settings that affect its behaviour, functioning and interactions with other players.

### General settings

Probably the most important setting of every station is its **name**. It can be changed at any time in the station’s *general settings*:

![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-01-18-21-03.png)

In addition, on this screen you can
- *rotate* the station
- *dismantle* it (note, this effectively means *canceling the station*!!)

### Attack settings

In this section, the station owner can determine who the station weapons will attack. Of course, this only applies if weapon blocks have been built and equipped with weapons. There are 4 attack options to choose from:

![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-01-20-17-02.png)

After choosing one of the options, the station will attack objects that
- do not belong to the owner (if you do not have a special reason, **do not choose** this option!)
- do not belong to the owner or their allies (a very aggressive setting)
- are considered enemies (players with *Enemy* status and all kinds of Evil) – this is the recommended option
- are not to be attacked (weapons are deactivated)

### Station visibility

The station’s visibility setting determines which players will see the station on the radar, in the sector map, and in global search results (keyboard shortcut `U`). This setting is located in the same tab as *Attack settings*:

![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-01-20-25-44.png)

You can choose from the following options for who can see the station:
- no one except the owner
- the owner and players belonging to the same zone
- the owner and players with *Ally* status
- the owner and players with *Ally* and *Neutral* status
- all players

> **Important:**
> If you want to trade with NPC players, your station visibility must be set to *all players*. Otherwise NPC players will not be able to find the station and therefore will not be able to buy from it.

## Replacing the command block

Once a player gains more experience, earns more money and has sufficient reserves of construction materials, they can replace their command block with a better one or even completely change the block type. Higher-level command blocks generally provide better base parameters for energy gain and capacity, maintenance and accommodation.

> The command block is replaced by *dismantling* the current block, whereby the construction materials are “thrown into space around the station”. These materials can be collected and reused to build the new command block. This means that when replacing the block you do not need to own the full amount of materials required to build the station.

1. After docking at the station, open the Bridge
2. Move the mouse cursor over the command block
3. At the top, choose the button to replace the block

   ![](../assets/images/stavba_stanice_images/2025-12-02-09-56-14.png)

4. In the new window select the new command block
5. After confirming, undock with a (cargo) ship, collect the materials around the station, and use them to build the new block

> **Important:**
> During the construction of the new block, the station *has no command block* and none of its facilities. Therefore, until the block construction is completed, the station may not provide some services unless they are provided by another block (e.g. a Hangar).
